As a Researcher at TikTok, I focus on the research and application on AI Security and Privacy. Before joining TikTok, I completed my Ph.D. at Fudan University in 2025 under the supervision of Dr. [Wenqiang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vL-VEJYAAAAJ&hl=en) as part of the Robotics-Oriented Intelligence Lab (ROILab). I hold a B.E. degree, which I received from Shandong University in 2020

I have published **more than 20 papers** in top international journals and conferences (CVPR, NeurIPS, ICCV, etc.), including **8 papers** as first author or co-first author. In addition, I am the team leader of the AI ​​security group in ROILab, supervising 4 PhDs and 2 Masters.
