<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am a fourth-year bachelor-straight-to-doctorate student at Academy for Engineering and Technology of Fudan University. As a part of Lab of Robotics Oriented Intelligence (ROILab), I am advised by [Wenqiang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vL-VEJYAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to this, I received the B.E. degree in Shandong University in 2020. In addition, from 2021.04 to 2024.04, I served as a research intern and was advised by [Bo Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NVzQ87sAAAAJ&hl=en) in Youtu Lab, Tencent. 

I have published **more than 20 papers** in top international journals and conferences (CVPR, NeurIPS, ICCV, etc.), including **8 papers** as first author or co-first author. In addition, I am the team leader of the AI ​​security group in ROILab, supervising 4 PhDs and 2 Masters.

In the fall of 2024, I will be entering the job market, seeking positions in the industry that align with my expertise and passion. My academic and research experiences have provided me with a solid foundation in **AI security, AI-generated content (AIGC), and multimodal large models.** I am particularly interested in industrial roles that allow me to contribute to developing and implementing AI technologies, ensuring their safety and efficacy. 

I am eager to leverage my knowledge and skills in a dynamic and innovative industrial environment, where I can continue to grow and make meaningful contributions to the field of artificial intelligence.

### Research Interest:
- **AI Security:** Adversarial Patch, Video Adversarial Example, and Black-box Attack
- **Robustness and Generalization:** Adversarial Distillation, Pre-Training Model
- **Artificial Intelligence Generated Content:** Image Editing, Adversarial Content Generation, Multimodal Model
